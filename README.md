# MultiLayerPerceptron
# Add random noise (see below on size parameter on np.random.normal) to the images in training and testing. Make sure each image gets a different noise feature added to it. 
# Inspect by printing out several images. Note - the size parameter should match the data.
# Compare the accuracy of train and val after N epochs for MLNN with and without noise.
# Vary the amount of noise by changing the scale parameter in np.random.normal by a factor. Use .1, .5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 for the scale and keep track of the accuracy for training and validation and plot these results.
